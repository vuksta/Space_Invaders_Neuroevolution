# Evolutionary Game AI

This project implements a neuroevolutionary approach to game AI, where neural networks evolve through genetic algorithms to master classic video games. The system maintains a population of neural networks, each representing a different playing strategy, and uses evolutionary operators (selection, crossover, and mutation) to iteratively improve their performance. Through this process, the networks learn optimal game-playing behaviors by evolving their weights and architecture.

```python
def _build_model(self):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(INPUT_SIZE,)),
        *[tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu') 
          for units in HIDDEN_LAYERS],
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(OUTPUT_SIZE, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model
```

### Genetic Operators
```python
def mutate(self, mutation_rate):
    weights = self.get_weights()
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        if np.random.random() < mutation_rate:
            mutation = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, weights[i].shape)
            weights[i] += mutation
    self.set_weights(weights)
```
